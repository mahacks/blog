On Tuesday October 3rd, 2017, MAHacks director Justin Yu (Winchester High School) and fellow organizer Katherine Huang (Lowell High School) were invited to attend dinner in Boston’s North End with Mike Swift and Jonathan Gottfried, founders of Major League Hacking and Forbes 30 Under 30 honorees. 

Hackathon organizers from across the world such as HackMIT (Massachsetts Institute of Technology), BostonHacks (Boston University), HackWITUs (Wentworth), HackGT (Georgia Institute of Technology), HackRU (Rutgers University), and Hack Sheffield (Sheffield, England), attended the event. Representing the only high school hackathon, Justin and Katherine took the opportunity to connect with other passionate leaders and receive advice for running hackathons.

MAHacks’ attendance at the Forbes U30 Summit marked the beginning of its preparation for the upcoming 2017-2018 year. After their first successful year, the MAHacks organization team is eager to prepare for the next year’s winter and spring hackathons! 

Stay tuned for MAHacks III.

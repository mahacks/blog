Hackathons. Some of my most cherished weekends were spent with a group of friends coding through the night, surrounded by an absurd amount of red bull. However, with each hackathon I attended, I began to see a problem: modern hacker culture encourages flashy projects with no real-world application beyond the 24-hours of their inception. To solve this, a group of students and I founded MAHacks. Our mission? To bring together entrepreneurs, those with long-term venture ideas, and hackers, those with the skillset to implement those ideas, all into one event, with the hope of generating projects with lasting impact.

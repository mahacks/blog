This is a sample post. Posts are in the `_posts` folder and written in Markdown. Here's a [link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to a Markdown cheatsheet.

### Use 3 pound symbols for headers, please

I only coded `h2` (for post titles) and `h3` (for sections inside posts) styles (though it's not hard to add more).

Some more text to make the post longer. MAHacks III, a high school hackathon, will be held on Saturday, January 13, 2018 from 8 AM to 10 PM at Upstatement in Boston. Whether you're a beginner, seasoned developer, or an entrepreneur with an idea, join a team or bring a project idea and you'll create something unforgettable.

MAHacks is run for high schoolers, by high schoolers. Our goal is to bring together entrepreneurial-minded and tech-savvy students to form truly impactful projects that last beyond our event. In the past, we've held events at MIT and Canopy Coworking City. We hope you'll join us for MAHacks III!

### Another header

At MAHacks III, you can submit your project in one of our tracks and win special prizes provided by our sponsors! We want to promote hacks that solve problems and that you'll be excited to continue after MAHacks. Help solve a problem in the medical industry and you could win the chance to continue your project with Boston Children's Hospital! More information coming soon.

A hackathon is a 12 hour coding event where students and developers work together to create products and designs. There will be a lot of free stuff, free food, and prizes! Any high schooler interested is welcome, regardless of skill level! For the first couple of hours, we will help you network with other students. You can find people you want to work with and make a team on the day of!
